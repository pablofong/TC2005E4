            <small>Journalists and news publishers play a key role in helping us understand important events as they
                unfold and at Google we're dedicated to supporting the reporters and publishers who work tirelessly to
                deliver us news.</small><br>
            <small>Today, we're announcing our latest product supporting journalism in Slovenia by rolling out Google
                News Showcase, our curated online experience and licensing program for news publishers. Google has
                agreements with
                six national, regional and local news organizations from Slovenia, which provide important news coverage
                to people all over the country, including <u>Delo</u>, <u>Casnik Finance</u>, <u>Siol.net</u>,
                <u>Slovenske novice</u>, <u>Slovenska tiskovna agencija</u>
                and <u>Styria Media si</u>.</small><br>
            <small>News Showcase gives participating publishers in Slovenia more ways to engage with readers by giving
                them a way to curate their news through different panels that appear on Google News and Discover. These
                panels,
                which direct readers to the full articles on publishers' websites, provide news organizations with the
                ability to give readers daily snapshots of what they think is important, provide more context into
                important news
                stories, and add related articles, timelines and more.</small><br>

        <h2>News Showcase is launching in France</h2>

            <small>Over the past 20 years, we've collaborated closely with journalists from around the world to support
                a sustainable, independent and diverse news industry.</small><br>
            <small>Building on our partnership with French publishers, today we're announcing the launch of Google News
                Showcase in France, with more than 65 publishers representing more than 130 publications. These include
                national,
                regional and local news outlets like <u>20 minutes</u>, <u>La Dépêche</u>, <u>L'Equipe</u>,
                <u>L'Express</u>, <u>Le Figaro</u>, <u>La Provence</u>, <u>Le Monde</u>, <u>Groupe EBRA</u> and <u>Le
                    Parisien</u></small><br>
            <small>News Showcase gives participating publishers in France more ways to engage with readers, and directs
                them to full articles on news publications' websites. This enables publishers to deepen their
                relationships with
                readers - and gives them more direct control of presentation and branding. Our French news partners'
                News Showcase panels will begin appearing on Google News on Android, iOS and the web, and in Discover on
                iOS
                and Android.</small>
