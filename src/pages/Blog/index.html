          >Journalists and news publishers play a key role in helping us
          understand important events as they unfold and at Google we're
          dedicated to supporting the reporters and publishers who work
          tirelessly to deliver us news.</small

        <small
          >Today, we're announcing our latest product supporting journalism in
          Slovenia by rolling out Google News Showcase, our curated online
          experience and licensing program for news publishers. Google has
          agreements with six national, regional and local news organizations
          from Slovenia, which provide important news coverage to people all
          over the country, including <u>Delo</u>, <u>Casnik Finance</u>,
          <u>Siol.net</u>, <u>Slovenske novice</u>,
          <u>Slovenska tiskovna agencija</u> and <u>Styria Media si</u>.</small
        ><br />
        <small
          >News Showcase gives participating publishers in Slovenia more ways to
          engage with readers by giving them a way to curate their news through
          different panels that appear on Google News and Discover. These
          panels, which direct readers to the full articles on publishers'
          websites, provide news organizations with the ability to give readers
          daily snapshots of what they think is important, provide more context
          into important news stories, and add related articles, timelines and
          more.</small

          >News Showcase gives participating publishers in France more ways to
          engage with readers, and directs them to full articles on news
          publications' websites. This enables publishers to deepen their
          relationships with readers - and gives them more direct control of
          presentation and branding. Our French news partners' News Showcase
          panels will begin appearing on Google News on Android, iOS and the
          web, and in Discover on iOS and Android.</small
